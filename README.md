Visualization and Exploration of Word Embeddings

This project aims to take a look at two of the most popular word embedding algorithms. Both algorithms are trained on different datasets and we explore using principal component analysis, and clustering in order to better understand the relationships created by our word embeddings. 

We then provide a quick example which illustrates just how important our input data can be in determining the word embeddings generated. 

Prerequisites

No software needs to be downloaded to view the analysis. 

Some knowledge of PCA, clustering, and vector spaces would be helpful in understanding this analysis.
